Translated(src=it, dest=en, text=What shines
 In the high galleries?
 Close the door, my son:
 Eleven have played.
 In my eyes, without wanting,
 Four lanterns shine.
 They will be those
 who polish the cooking branches.
 
 Languid silver mirror
 The falling moon puts
 yellow wigs
 on the yellow towers.
 The trembling night knocks
 to the glass of the balconies,
 chased by a thousand
 dogs who don't know her,
 and an smell of wine and amber
 comes out of the galleries.
 
 Wet rod breeze
 and sound of ancient voices
 they echoed in the arch
 broken midnight.
 Oxen and roses slept.
 Only for the galleries
 The four lights rose
 with the fury of San Giorgio.
 Sad women of the valley
 they brought the blood of man,
 quiet of cut flower
 And bitter of young thigh.
 Old women of the river
 cried under the mountain
 A unsurpassed minute
 of hair and names.
 Lime facades made
 Square and white at night.
 Serafini and Gitani
 They played accordion.
 Mother, when to die,
 The gentlemen know it.
 Send blue telegrams
 who go from south to north.
 Seven shouts, seven sangui,
 Seven double poppies,
 they broke opaque lune
 In dark galleries.
 Full of cut hands
 and of flowers of flowers,
 The sea of oaths
 He resonated, who knows where.
 And the sky slammed the door
 to the abrupt noise of the forest,
 while the lights rose
 in the high galleries., pronunciation=None, extra_data="{'confiden...")
