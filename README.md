# PyTranslate

A very simple Python translation module using GoogleTranslate API and langedect Python library.
Especially good for translating poetic lyrics.

The program was written to create interlinear translations, for more accurate translation and further processing.
To make interlinear translations more exact English was chosen as translation language.

Googletrans library has certain issues. I used version 4.0.0rc1 to avoid errors, but it's necessary to keep abreast.
